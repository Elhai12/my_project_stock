The project presents data on a stock by its symbol
## The information is organized by three categories:
* General information about the stock, including metadata and fundamental data.
* Up-to-date information, including the current closing price, the previous day's closing price, and the percentage change.
* Historical information, including a table with historical data, performance graphs, and the ability to compare the stock to selected indices.

### How to use the website:
1. Select a date range (by default, it is set to the last week) and insert the stock symbol you want information about
(You can use the table on the right to find companies in the S&P 500).

2. After pressing Enter, the tabs with the information will appear.

Under the "Compare stock with index" tab, choose an index
(by default, it is set to the S&P 500)
and the graph will display the cumulative return comparison for the selected period.
